# Wayz

[Wayz](http://www.flywithwayz.com/) is a travel web app that allows users to search for flights based on price and choose flights to track over time. 

The web app lets users search for available flights based on price and date or find all available flights to a popular destination for the month. Users can filter search results by location and budget.

When a user selects a flight they will be redirected to a details view which will display flight information. From the details view a user can click Book Now or Add To Watchlist. Booking the flight redirects the user to an outside service to purchase the flight. 

If a user is logged in clicking Add To Watchlist will add the flight to a users watchlist. A user can always be redirected to their watchlist from the navbar on any view in the web app. The watchlist is where a users flights are tracked. The watchlist displays the origin, desitination, budget, and flights that meet that criteria for each trip added to the watchlist.
